<h1 id="whales-lat-cetus">Whales, lat.Cetus</h1>
<p>Today I am presenting some interesting facts about whales. The inspiration for this post came from watching the film &quot;Blackfish,&quot; which is about orcas in captivity. This movie was quite inspiring for me, and as a result, I have gathered some interesting facts to share.</p>
<p>Firstly, I will discuss their name in Latin. In Latin, the name for whale is &quot;Cetus,&quot; which translates to &quot;sea monster.&quot; Interestingly, there is a story about a sea monster named Cetus. It all began when Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia, bragged about her daughter Andromeda&#39;s beauty, which angered the god Poseidon. As a result, Poseidon sent the sea monster Cetus to destroy the shores of the region. Cassiopeia and her husband Cepheus sought advice from an oracle who advised them to sacrifice their daughter to the monster to appease the god. The couple agreed and chained Andromeda to a rock by the sea. However, just before Cetus could attack her, Perseus arrived and discovered what was happening. He freed Andromeda and either killed the monster with his sword or used Medusa&#39;s head to turn it to stone.</p>
